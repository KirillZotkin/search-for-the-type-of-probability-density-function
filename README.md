File # 1 solves the problem of the calculus of variations, in which the extremum of the functional, presented in the form of Shannon's entropy and restrictions on the first 3 initial moments of distribution, is sought using the Euler equation, provided that the utility function satisfies certain conditions. The resulting solution, which is a probability density function for X, is verified by the Jacobi and Legendre condition that the functional reaches the weak minimum condition on the resulting extremal. You can find additional comments in the file.
File # 2 proposes a method for finding unknown parameters of the obtained probability density function and comparing this function (with the obtained coefficients) with a normal distribution. The comparison is made in order to show the difference between the real probability density function of an unknown quantity and a normal distribution, which is often used as an assumption about the distribution of asset returns.
